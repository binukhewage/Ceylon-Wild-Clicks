  <h2>A Landscape Where Lives Overlap</h2>
  <p>Across Sri Lanka, it’s not uncommon to see elephants grazing near farmland, walking alongside rural roads, or appearing unexpectedly near villages. These moments can feel beautiful — even magical — but they also reveal a deeper issue: the shrinking distance between human spaces and elephant habitats.</p>

  <p>This blog explores why these encounters happen, the challenges they create, and how visitors can support peaceful coexistence.</p>

  <h2>Why Elephants Move Into Human Spaces</h2>
  <p>Elephants have followed the same natural routes for centuries. These paths once stretched across uninterrupted forests, but today many of them pass through farmlands, settlements, and infrastructure.</p>
  <p>As Sri Lanka develops, elephants are left with less space and fewer wild food sources.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Habitat loss from agriculture and construction</li>
    <li>Fragmented forests that break elephant movement patterns</li>
    <li>Blocked migration paths due to fences, roads, and projects</li>
    <li>Fertile crops that attract elephants seeking easy food</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These movements are not random — they’re driven by necessity.</p>

  <h2>What Happens When Humans and Elephants Meet</h2>
  <p>Encounters between humans and elephants can be unpredictable. For people living in rural areas, crop damage can mean losing months of income. For elephants, entering human spaces often increases risk of injury or death.</p>

  <h3>Impacts on communities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of crops and livelihoods</li>
    <li>Damage to property</li>
    <li>Safety concerns and stress</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Impacts on elephants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Train collisions</li>
    <li>Electrocution</li>
    <li>Injuries from traps or conflict situations</li>
    <li>Increased stress and disrupted behaviour</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps Toward Coexistence</h2>
  <p>Sri Lanka has become a global example of the challenges and importance of living alongside wildlife. Many organizations, communities, and experts are working to reduce conflict and protect elephants.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Elephant corridors that reconnect migration routes</li>
    <li>Community early-warning systems</li>
    <li>Elephant-friendly fencing and safe farming practices</li>
    <li>Conservation research, tracking, and monitoring</li>
    <li>Education programs promoting safe behaviour</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These initiatives focus not on separating humans and elephants, but on helping them share space safely.</p>

  <h2>How Visitors Can Support Positive Change</h2>
  <p>Tourism has a direct influence on wildlife conservation. Responsible travel choices help protect elephants and support local communities.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Choose ethical safari operators</li>
    <li>Keep a respectful distance from elephants</li>
    <li>Avoid feeding or approaching wild elephants</li>
    <li>Follow park guidelines</li>
    <li>Support conservation-focused projects and tours</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p>Sri Lanka’s elephants are a symbol of strength, history, and natural beauty. As human landscapes expand and wildlife habitats change, the challenge lies in finding balance — a way for both humans and elephants to continue sharing the landscapes they have occupied together for centuries.</p>

  <p>By understanding the complexities of the Human–Elephant Conflict, we take the first step toward supporting coexistence and ensuring a safer future for these remarkable animals.</p>

    excerpt:
      "From the dense rainforests of Sinharaja to the azure depths of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka offers a concentration of life that rivals continents.",

      <h2>The Island of Endless Life</h2>
      <p>Despite its small size, Sri Lanka is a biological treasure trove, recognized as one of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots. The island's geography—ranging from coastal lowlands to misty central highlands—creates a mosaic of climates that support an astonishing variety of life.</p>

      <h2>The Rainforests: A Genetic Vault</h2>
      <p>In the wet zone lies the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage site. This primary tropical rainforest is an evolutionary laboratory.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Endemism:</strong> More than 60% of the trees are endemic to Sri Lanka.</li>
        <li><strong>Avian Life:</strong> It is home to the elusive Blue Magpie and the Red-faced Malkoha.</li>
        <li><strong>Canopy Layers:</strong> The dense canopy creates a unique microclimate where amphibians and reptiles thrive in isolation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Dry Zone: Giants Roam Here</h2>
      <p>Transitioning to the dry zone, the landscape opens up into scrub jungles and grasslands (villus). Parks like Yala and Wilpattu offer visibility that rivals the African savannah.</p>
      <p>Here, the Sri Lankan Elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) gathers in large herds, and the Sloth Bear scours for termites and Palu fruit. It is a land of extremes, ruled by the monsoon rains.</p>

      <h2>The Ocean Frontier</h2>
      <p>Biodiversity extends beyond the shoreline. The deep waters off Mirissa and Trincomalee are the playground of the Blue Whale, the largest animal to ever live. Sperm whales, dolphins, and diverse coral reefs complete this ecological masterpiece.</p>

      <h2>Preserving the Balance</h2>
      <p>To witness Sri Lanka's biodiversity is a privilege. It reminds us that we are but one note in a vast, complex symphony of life that requires our protection to keep playing.</p>

      <h2>The Ghost of the Jungle</h2>
      <p>The Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is the apex predator of the island. With no lions or tigers to compete with, these leopards have evolved to be larger and more confident than their cousins elsewhere in the world.</p>
      
      <h2>Yala: The Leopard Capital</h2>
      <p>Yala National Park boasts one of the highest leopard densities in the world. The park's rocky outcrops and open scrub provide the perfect terrain for these spotted cats to hunt and rest.</p>

      <h2>Ethical Photography Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patience is Key:</strong> Don't chase the animal. Wait at waterholes or known territories.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect the Space:</strong> Use a long lens (400mm+) to get close-ups without disturbing the subject.</li>
        <li><strong>Silence:</strong> Noise stresses the animal. Keep voices low and engines off when stationary.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Capturing a leopard in the golden hour light is the ultimate prize, but the welfare of the animal must always come before the shot.</p>
